This plugin allows users to check the effective ground acceleration by region based on the seismic hazard map. It can be used for a precise evaluation of earthquake risk for a specific site.
 
Since this plugin is created based on images provided on Korean Design Standard (KDS), the values are estimates and have been implemented using linear interpolation.
 
How to Use
 
Confirm the design standards (KDS 17 10 00:2024).
Set the return period (supports 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2400, and 4800 years).
Confirm the input type (by Address or by Latitude/Longitude).
Enter the target address and click the Search button.
